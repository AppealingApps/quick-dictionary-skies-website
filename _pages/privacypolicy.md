# Quick Dictionary Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. Because I don't need to know any personal information, I don't collect any personal information. Quick Dictionary is designed from the ground up to preserve your privacy.

If you e-mail me for support, I have access to your e-mail address and any information you include in your e-mail. No other personal data leaves your device.

## Personally Identifying Information
Quick Dictionary does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device.

## Business Transfers
If Quick Dictionary, Appealing Apps LLC, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Appealing Apps LLC goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As Quick Dictionary does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)

## Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Quick Dictionary may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Appealing Apps LLC's sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

## Indemnity
You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.
